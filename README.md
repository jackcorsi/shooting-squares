# shooting-squares
This is a Javascript and HTML canvas-based minigame I made during the school holidays once, preserved in its (mostly) original form for historical purposes and for when I still fancy playing younger me's creation. Bright blue squares descend from the sky like the coming of the apocalypse, and you must hold out for as long as you can with your equally blocky weapon of choice. Any similarity to (a) commercial game(s) is purely coincidental and not the result of plaigiarism in any form.

The original commit history is lost because I didn't know how to do source control at the time.

If for some reason you want to actually play this, [be my guest](https://jackcorsi.dev/shooting-squares)
